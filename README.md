# Bird Up

This game was made in a three-hour hackathon by [oisincar](https://github.com/oisincar), [Zantier](https://github.com/Zantier), and myself.  
It's impossible to win, and unsatisfying to lose.

## The Game

You are a spaceship. You are under assault from a legion of evil '#'  
characters. The aim is to stay alive long enough to stop acting like an  
immature 20-year-old spaceship, maybe develop a meaningful relationship with an  
attractive spaceship of a similar or opposite gender, perhaps get a hobby,  
settle down into the house you plan to get a mortgage on, etc.

Of course, all of this is purely hypothetical, as you're going to lose after  
playing for a few seconds to a minute anyway.
